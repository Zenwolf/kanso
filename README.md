Kanso
============================================================

Kanso is a light-weight architecture for thick-client
browser web applications. Kanso's philosophy is to
provide simple systems that can be used at your own 
discretion. You can use these patterns in many ways.
Kanso molds to the skill of the user.

Unstable; in development.


Overview
------------------------------------------------------------

Kanso focuses on encapsulating state and logic, separating them from the UI layer. Like a game, state is sent to the rendering layer to be transformed into something visible.

Kanso's systems were inspired by various game architectures. Kanso applies these techniques to improve web application performance and rendering in ways unbound by convention.

Kanso's logic portions were heavily-inspired by Domain Driven Design and CQRS.
